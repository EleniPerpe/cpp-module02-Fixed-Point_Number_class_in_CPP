This repository contains a series of exercises focused on implementing a fixed-point number class in C++. The exercises are designed to help you learn important C++ concepts such as operator overloading, memory management, and the Orthodox Canonical Form for class design.

In these exercises, you will implement a class representing a fixed-point number, with an integer value and a set number of fractional bits. This class will simulate the behavior of fixed-point arithmetic, offering performance and accuracy benefits for specific domains like computer graphics, sound processing, or scientific computations.

The project follows the Orthodox Canonical Form, which requires the implementation of four core functions: the default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor.
